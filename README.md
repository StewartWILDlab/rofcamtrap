# ROF Camera Trap Data Analysis Research Compedium

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/StewartWILDlab/rofcamtrap/main?urlpath=rstudio)

Prerequisites:

- docker
- nvidia-container-toolkit

## Main Workflow

1.  At the terminal, clone this repository.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/StewartWILDlab/rofcamtrap
```

2.  Build the docker image of the computing environment, by running the
    build script. This will also build the apptainer image needed on
    HPC.

``` bash
rofcamtrap/dockerfiles/build.sh
```

3.  Run docker image, with the proper volumes. We currently have two
    separate storage volumes, for each of the two camera retrievals that
    took place. We also make sure to hook the `rofcamtrap` folder as a
    volume.

``` bash
# -e DISABLE_AUTH=true --shm-size 50G
sudo docker run \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspace/rofcamtrap" \
  -v "/media/vlucet/TrailCamST/TrailCamStorage:/workspace/storage/TrailCamStorage" \
  -v "/media/vlucet/My Passport/Images:/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \
  --gpus all \
  -it rofcamtrap
```

4.  Activate ENV, then run mega detector on images using the bash
    script.

``` bash
mamba activate cameratraps-detector
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh \
  -b "/workspace/git" \
  -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \ 
  -m "/workspace/models/md_v5a.0.0.pt" \
  md
```

5.  Run the repeat detector using the bash script, and remove all
    instances of trues positives.

``` bash
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh \
  -b "/workspace/git" \
  -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \
  -i "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/0_outputs" \
  repeat-detect
```

6.  Patch MDâ€™s output with the repeat detect results.

``` bash
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh \
  -b "/workspace/git" \
  -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \
  -i "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/0_outputs" \
  -o "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/1_outputs_no_repeats" \
  repeat-remove
```

7.  Optionally, write out the visualizations of the detections.

``` bash
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh \
  -b "/workspace/git" \
  -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \
  -i "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/1_outputs_no_repeats/" \
  -o "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/2_visualize/" \
  viz
```

8.  Convert to coco and ls \[and 3rd format?\].

``` bash
mamba deactivate 
cd mdtools
poetry shell
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh \
  -b "/workspace/git" \
  -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" \
  -i "/workspace/rofcamtrap/1_MegaDetector/1_outputs_no_repeats/" \
  -o "/workspace/rofcamtrap/2_LabelStudio/0_inputs/" \
  repeat-convert
```

## Classifier training workflow

On beluga, we use the apptainer iamge instead.

``` bash
. /workspace/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh 
. /workspace/conda/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh
PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
mamba activate cameratraps-detector
rofcamtrap/scripts/bash/camtrap.sh -b "/workspace/git" -s "/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" -m "/workspace/models/md_v5a.0.0.pt" md

$ mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/apptainer/{cache,tmp}
$ export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR="/scratch/$USER/apptainer/cache"
$ export APPTAINER_TMPDIR="/scratch/$USER/apptainer/tmp"

salloc --time=00:05:00 --mem=4G --ntasks=1 --gpus-per-task=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --account=rrg-fstewart

apptainer shell --nv -C -B "$(pwd):/workspace/rofcamtrap"  -B "/media/vlucet/TrailCamST/TrailCamStorage:/workspace/storage/TrailCamStorage"  -B "/media/vlucet/My Passport/Images:/workspace/storage/my_passport_images" rofcamtrap.sif

apptainer shell --nv -C -B "$(pwd):/workspace/rofcamtrap" -B "/home/vlucet/projects/rrg-fstewart/vlucet:/workspace/project/" rofcamtrap.sif
```

### Species classifier

### False detections classifier

## LabelStudio instance setup

## Labelme? WildTrax?

## Reports

The **reports** directory currently contains the `GnC_report` folder
wich is structured as such:

- [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): Quarto source document for
  manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
  generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
  `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
  and tables in this file)
- [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
- [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
  illustrations
- [:file_folder:
  supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
  Supplementary materials including notes and other documents prepared
  and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/main.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open
`analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run
`rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd")` in the R console
